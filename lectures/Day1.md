Download the most recent stable version of the drupal vdd project: https://www.drupal.org/project/vdd
- (download the zip file highlighted in green on that page)
Unzip that file, place the 'vdd' folder in Desktop/Sites/

Stop and do the following 2 tutorials if you're unfamiliar with using command line:
1. http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/commandline.php
2. http://ryanstutorials.net/linuxtutorial/navigation.php

Using command prompt (or terminal if a mac user), navigate to Desktop/Sites/vdd 
- In the command prompt, execute the command: vagrant up
- This command will take a while. Go to 192.168.44.44 in your browser to check if it finished successfully. 
  If so, that page will say *Welcome to VDD!*
  If not, and you are very confident that the script has completed, then run vagrant up again.
